# Arancina
The **Arancina** (**A**utonomous **R**AM **AN**alysis **CI**rcuit for **N**ot-broken **A**rrays) is a FPGA-based tool for testing the functionality of a DDR RAM, checking its characteristics and operating status through a series of test procedures.

The first prototype is built upon a Terasic [DE0-Nano](https://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?No=593) board, connected to an external DDR memory chip through a custom shield ([DDRacula](pcb/ddracula)), and using an LCD display and a bunch of buttons as user interface.

The tool is still **under heavy development** and not ready for use.
